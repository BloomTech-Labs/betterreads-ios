Readrr is an app, that enables users to organize/track the books that they've read, the books that they're reading, and which features of books are most important to them. It provides incentives to motivate them to achieve their reading goals, and all of that with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Readrr allows you to have a centralized location to organize and track the books that you've read, are currently reading, and/or books that you would like to read in the future. Readrr is also a great way to easily discover new books with recommendations based on your personal library collection. 

Since Readrr allows you to track your reading progress on the go, you can accomplish more reading goals and have a form of accountability. No need to go to multiple places to find the information or features about books that interest you; you can simply search and view book details in the Readrr app. Readrr supports searching for different medium types too! Whether you like to turn physical pages, read on a tablet, or listen on the go, Readrr can track you book progess no matter the medium. With Readrr's conveninent and user-friendly interface, tracking reading process is easy!
